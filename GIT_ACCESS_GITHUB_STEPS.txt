git push not working ?
	1. create a remote git connection to github.
		1.1 for this I have to create a new repository in github first.
		1.2 secondly in my local machine i have to add the url of the created repository 
			along with an alias name that will be used in my loacl machine 
			when i do git push
		1.3 now git push command can be given like this:
			GIT PUSH <ALIAS NAME> 
			1.3.1 this above command will push all the files which are staged in commit
		1.4 now git will ask for username and password
			1.4.1 username will be same as the username in the github/git user
				like mitz88
			1.4.2 but when git will ask for password i cannot give the github account password.
				Since 2021 , i guss, this password authentication has been removed.
			1.4.3 github_pat_11AIL4XJI0ZA4v3MOVbIA_5XRixyqZd3Zx7BoAwj251IDW5VIDXEHL3pqWz6k4cJ0Q2JPPF4DMxLn8dkS
Instead of the password authentication git now accepts tokens for authentication.
				I can generate a token from github account settings. I have to give some additional 
				repository access permissions for push to work.
			1.4.4 now after all  these changes github will accept push from local system.
